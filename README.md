# JOINUS
Graphical user interface for the Josephson simulator programs.


# FOREWORD
*Josephson interface utility software* (JOINUS) is a program developed at the IMEP-LAHC laboratory, CNRS UMR5130 at Universit√© Savoie Mont Blanc, France as part of COLDFLUX/SuperTools project. The first objective is to simplify the design and simulation process of analog, digital and mixed signal circuits based on Josephson junctions. The second objective is to improve the accuracy of models for simulations and the features of software tools. JOINUS uses JSIM or JoSIM simulation engines for digital circuits. It will include later more simulators such as WRSPICE, an improvement of SPICE3 , or PSCAN. JOINUS embeds a powerful built-in plotter to automatically plot output results. Other open-source plotters like GNUPlot or XMGrace are also available from the JOINUS interface.
